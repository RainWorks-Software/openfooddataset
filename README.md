# OpenFoodDataset
This is our own api interface for the data provided by [Open Food Facts](https://github.com/openfoodfacts), an open, collaborative, and free dataset for food products.

### Motivation 
The OpenFoodFacts website and API are quite slow to use and would not work for our intended purposes. Additionally, we did not want to further stress the network nor compete with their open source product (which is totally awesome), which is why we host our own mirror of the API with our own functionality implemented.
